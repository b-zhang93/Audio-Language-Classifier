`notebooks/Prototyping_CNN_Models.ipynb` - created neural network models from scratch as class objects using Object Oriented Programming and Pytorch. They can be instantiated with hyperparameters. Cleaned up the functions and minimalized everything to be more efficient. Prototyped several different models and tuning hyperparameters as well.

`notebooks/Exploring Generalizability.ipynb` - scraped audio files from YouTube to test the model how it performs on real-world external data. Evaluating how generalizable the models are after only being trained using voice clips from one data repository. Then selecting the best performing model from both the prototyping and generalizability evaluations as our final exhaustive model to use for the web app.
